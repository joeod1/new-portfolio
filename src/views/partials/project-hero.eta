    <p>Like the game "Snake", but your character just splits when it collides with itself. This project taught me a lot about designing complex systems, as all interactions, behaviors, inputs, and physics were written from scratch. The cost of these are brought down with a chunking system; offscreen entities are not rendered and receive fewer logic calls.</p>
